This report evaluates the profitability of a momentum strategy applied to U.S. equities over the post-Global Financial Crisis period from July 2009 to December 2024. The strategy is implemented across all 16 combinations of formation period J ∈ {3, 6, 9, 12} months and holding period K ∈ {3, 6, 9, 12} months, with a one-month skip between formation and holding. Two investment universes are considered: the Top-1500 and Top-3000 stocks by market capitalization at the time of portfolio formation.

The Summary of the output
1.Universe difference
Within the Top-1500 universe, momentum generates positive average WML returns across most combinations, particularly for short-to-medium formation periods. By contrast, within the Top-3000 universe, all 16 configurations produce negative average WML returns, some of which are statistically significant. 
2.Short formation periods outperform within Top-1500. 
For the Top-1500 universe, the best-performing configuration is J=9, K=3, with a mean monthly WML return of +0.324% and a cumulative return of +46.6% over the sample. More generally, J=3 and J=9 combined with short holding periods (K=3 or K=6) deliver the most consistent positive returns. As J increases to 12 months, performance deteriorates sharply, turning negative for K≥6. This is consistent with the well-documented return-reversal effect at the 12-month horizon.
3.Statistics outcome
None of these results have very high T-statistics. In the Top-3000 universe, several configurations reach t-statistics of −2.0 to −2.5, indicating statistically significant negative momentum.

Stock Selection Strategy
Large Cap Stock Strategy (Top-1500): Continue to use momentum for stock selection 
Small and Mid Cap Strategy (Top-3000): Switch to reversal stock selection 
The 12-month momentum turned out to be a trap, don't buy stocks that have risen for more than a year. 
Because of the significant negative T-statistic, in the Top-3000 stocks, short sell the stocks that have risen the best in the past and buy the stocks that have fallen the deepest.
